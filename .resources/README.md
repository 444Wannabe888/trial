Create-ZR-Offline.cmd can be used to make an updated [zr-offline.txt] resource file for ZipRipper offline mode.<br> 
It also allows users to see exactly how the resource file is made.<br>

When the script is finished, the newly created [zr-offline.txt] will appear in the same folder.

It is recommended that you use Create-ZR-Offline.cmd to create your own [zr-offline.txt], the archived version here is only needed if<br>
any of the included links become unavailable.<br>

**Offline mode can be enabled by putting [zr-offline.txt] in the same folder as ZipRipper before launch**
