ZippRipper can be used to create the [zr-offline.txt] resource file by clicking the letters JtR on John's hat.<br> 
When the process is finished, the newly created [zr-offline.txt] will appear in the same folder as the script.<br>

It is recommended that you use ZipRipper to create your own [zr-offline.txt], the archived version is only here in case<br>
any of the included links become unavailable.<br>

**Offline mode can be enabled by putting [zr-offline.txt] in the same folder as ZipRipper before launch**
